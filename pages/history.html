          <h1 class="h1-colour">Introduction to Amsterdam's History</h1>
          <p class="lead">Amsterdam started small as a fishing village in the 13th century. Back then, people mainly
            focused on protecting themselves from floods by building dikes and dams. But soon, ships from Amsterdam
            began traveling to far-off places like the Baltic Sea, setting the stage for trade. By the late 13th
            century, Amsterdam got special toll privileges, showing that it was becoming important. As time went on,
            more and more merchants came to Amsterdam, making it a big commercial center by the 15th century.</p>
          <p class="lead">In the 16th century, Amsterdam faced challenges from Spanish forces and had to deal with
            religious changes.
            There was a peaceful revolution in 1578 that changed things, and Amsterdam started to rebel against Spanish
            rule. When Antwerp fell in 1585, Amsterdam became a safe place for people escaping from different parts of
            Europe. This brought in lots of new people and helped Amsterdam grow even more, especially in business and
            culture.</p>

          <p class="text-center">The 17th century was a really good time for Amsterdam. They built new canals and fancy
            buildings, making the city look beautiful. Artists like Rembrandt and Vermeer became famous during this
            time. Amsterdam also became a big deal in finance, with the first stock exchange opening in 1602. This made
            people from all over want to come and invest in the city. It wasn't just about money though; Amsterdam
            became a center for art, trade, and smart ideas. This time is called the Dutch Golden Age because everything
            seemed to be going really well for the city.</p>

            <h2 class="h2-text">Modern Amsterdam</h2>
            <p class="text-center">In more recent times, Amsterdam has faced its share of challenges and changes. After
              going through some tough times during the Napoleonic period and World War I, the city started to pick up
              again in the 1920s. But then World War II brought more hardships, especially for the Jewish community.
              However, Amsterdam also saw brave acts of resistance against the Nazi regime, like the story of Anne
              Frank.
            </p>
            <p>After the war, Amsterdam had to rebuild. By the 1950s, things started improving. The economy grew, and
              the
              city became prosperous again. However, the 1960s brought big social and cultural changes worldwide, and
              Amsterdam was part of it. The city became more open-minded, especially about things like drugs and
              prostitution. This led to protests and movements that shaped Amsterdam's identity in the later part of the
              20th century.</p>
            <p>While protests have calmed down since the 1990s, Amsterdam remains known for its progressive values and
              lively atmosphere. Today, it's a bustling city that keeps changing. Its mix of old charm and modern life
              attracts people from all over. From its pretty canals to its vibrant neighborhoods, Amsterdam keeps
              reinventing itself while celebrating its past.</p>
