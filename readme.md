# Visit Amsterdam Website

## Description

This project is a website promoting tourism in Amsterdam. It provides information about the city's history, landmarks, culture, and lifestyle to encourage visitors to explore Amsterdam's unique charms.

## Navigation

The website includes a navigation bar with links to the home page, history page, and visit page. The navigation bar is responsive and collapses into an off-canvas menu on smaller screens for better usability.
I also created a footer at the end of each page which also allows users to navigate between different pages

## Layout

The layout of the website is designed to be visually appealing and easy to navigate. It includes:

- A hero section with a quote about Amsterdam and a background image.
- Informational sections about Amsterdam's attractions, culture, and lifestyle.
- Carousel sliders showcasing popular tourist attractions.
- Responsive design to ensure compatibility with various screen sizes and devices.

## Colour Choices

The colour scheme takes inspiration from the vibrant ambiance of Amsterdam's canals, boats, and neighbouring houses. Here's how each colour choice contributes to this inspiration:

- Primary colour: #6e081e (dark red) used for the navbar and footer background, creating contrast and visual appeal reminiscent of the brick houses found along the canals.
- Text colour: #17212d (dark grey) used for most of the text content to ensure readability and maintain a professional look and also to mirror the waters of the canals against the city's architecture.
- Accent colour: #fff (white) used for text and background contrast to improve readability and highlight important information.

- Also to mimic a darker version of the Netherlands flag, which is red, white and blue

## Challenges Faced

While developing the website, I encountered challenges in ensuring responsiveness across various devices and screen sizes. Specifically, I faced difficulties in making the pages display correctly on smaller devices, such as my phone. For instance, I struggled to fix a carousel glitch where the text wasn't displaying properly. Additionally, I noticed that some texts were appearing in white instead of black on certain devices. To address these issues, I had to manually force the colours to ensure consistent and readable text across all devices.

Moreover, implementing complex CSS layouts for sections like the hero section and informational sections presented another set of challenges. These sections required intricate designs to achieve the desired visual appeal and functionality, adding complexity to the development process.
